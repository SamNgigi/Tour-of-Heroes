# Tour of Heroes

## ng new

We can add some commands to `ng new ${project-name}` to modify how our app will be created/generated.

For example the below;

```
  ng new angular-tour-of-heroes --style scss --prefix toh
```

- `--style scss` that allows us to use sass.
- `--prefix toh` so that instead of `<app-componentName>` it would be `<toh-componentName>`
