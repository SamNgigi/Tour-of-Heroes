        Here when a user clicks on any of the generated <li> elements, we want to execute the onSelect(hero) function.

        So what is happening here is that after we have selected a hero.
        That value is stored in the selected_hero then it will be passed
        into this hero-detail component as an input so that we can access the value within that component.
